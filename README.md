# Video-Shot-Boundary-Detection-System
Video Shot Boundary Detection System

This application detects the start and end of each shot, regardless of if the shot starts/ends in a cut, or a gradual transition.

This application's algorithm is based on the Twin-comparison based approach as described in this research paper: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220461169_Automatic_Partitioning_of_Full-Motion_Video
